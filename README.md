A 3D model editing tool. Uses LÖVE for event loops, inputs and drawing 2D objects.

Steps to run:

1: Install LÖVE aka Love2D from the official website https://love2d.org/

The framework is mostly used for creating a window, getting keyboard and mouse input, and drawing 2D graphics.

2: In the project folder, open terminal and run the command love .

3: Done!

The project includes an example model (made with the tool itself), which can be opened by running 'load 3d/gem.txt' in the integrated terminal.
